# TicTacToe-MiniMax

This project aims to implement the MiniMax algorithm and conduct empirical testing to determine whether its practical performance aligns with the theoretical predictions of formal algorithmic analysis. MiniMax is a fundamental decision-making algorithm in game theory, commonly used in turn-based, perfect-information games. Our implementation will focus on Tic-Tac-Toe with a timing mechanism, introducing an additional dimension to decision-making.

Project Objectives:
-Implement a Brute-Force algorithm.
-Implement the MiniMax algorithm with optimizations to improve efficiency.
-Integrate a timing mechanism to enforce decision constraints on player moves.
-Evaluate algorithmic performance against theoretical expectations in a timed Tic-Tac-Toe environment.
-Analyze the impact of time constraints on optimal decision-making and overall gameplay outcomes.

Game Selection: To test the MiniMax algorithm, we will use a Timed Tic-Tac-Toe variant, which maintains the following conditions:
-Turn-based structure where players alternate moves.
-Perfect information ensuring all game states and available moves are known to both players.
-Real-time constraints require players to make decisions within a set time limit.

Methodology:
-Develop and test a MiniMax implementation for Tic-Tac-Toe.
-Conduct experiments to compare actual performance with theoretical predictions, varying time constraints and search depth.
-Collect and analyze data on move quality, decision time, and game outcomes.
-Draw conclusions on the effectiveness of MiniMax under real-time constraints and propose possible optimizations.

Expected Outcomes:
-Verification of whether real-world decision-making aligns with theoretical MiniMax predictions in a simple game setting.
-Insights into how time constraints impact algorithmic performance and player decision quality.
-Recommendations for improving MiniMax efficiency in real-time decision-making environments.
-This project will provide a practical exploration of game-theoretic decision-making using Tic-Tac-Toe as a testbed, bridging the gap between formal 
 algorithmic analysis and real-world application.
